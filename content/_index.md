# RAPE IS LEGAL


In 97.5% of cases, perpetrators of sexual violence face no consequences.


This isn't justice. This is a system designed to fail victims.


**Let's change it.**

## The Problem


- Only 310 out of 1,000 sexual assaults are reported to police
- Only 50 lead to arrest
- Only 28 are prosecuted
- Only 25 are incarcerated
- **97.5% of perpetrators walk free**


## Why This Happens


State rape laws are designed to exclude most rape:


- Require proof of "resistance" and exclude tonic immobility (but 70% of victims freeze)
- Exclude victims with disabilities that are temporary or situational
- Prioritize defendant's perspective over victim's reality
- Make prosecution nearly impossible


**Most rape is functionally legal.**
