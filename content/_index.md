# RAPE IS LEGAL


In 97.5% of cases, rapists face no consequences.


This isn't justice. This is a system designed to fail victims.


**Let's change it.**

## The Problem


- Only 310 out of 1,000 sexual assaults are reported to police
- Only 50 lead to arrest
- Only 28 prosecutions
- Only 25 incarcerations
- **97.5% of rapists walk free**


## Why This Happens


State rape laws are designed to exclude most rape:


- Require "physical resistance" (but 70% of victims freeze)
- Exclude tonic immobility (involuntary freeze response)
- Prioritize defendant's perspective over victim's reality
- Make prosecution nearly impossible


**Most rape is functionally legal.**
